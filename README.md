# Poindexter - social platform for book lovers

## Overview
Poindexter is a social media platform for book lovers, allowing users to share books they've read so others can borrow them. The application also helps users keep track of the books they've read. Additionally, users can comment on and rate books after returning them to the owner. To facilitate this, the owner can mark a book as publicly available or archive it. 

With this project, I aimed to practice building a full-stack application using Java Spring Boot and Angular, along with a database. I ensured the applicationâ€™s security using Spring Security and JWT Token Authentication. I also integrated an email service and dockerized the application's components for easier management. Additionally, I ensured a well-structured REST API using Swagger, as well as a responsive design.
